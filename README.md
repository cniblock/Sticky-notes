### Accessibility

![Accessibility Score](readmeimages/lighthouse.jpg)

A disappointing accessibility score, this is due to the bold colors of the note boxes.

## Unfixed Bugs

There are no unfixed bugs on the deployed page.

## Deployment

The website has been deployed for several days, and it has been very helpful in testing the website on numerous devices.

The process I followed for deploying the website is as follows:

- From my GitHub project, I went to **Settings**,
- Then selected **Pages** on the left-hand menu,
- Under **Source**, I selected Deploy from a branch,
- Finally, under **branch**, I set it to **main - root** and saved.
- The live website can be found here: <https://cniblock.github.io/sticky-notes/>

The vast majority of JavaScript credit goes to what was learned with CodeInstitute.
